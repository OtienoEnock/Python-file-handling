THE SUN RISES IN THE EAST.
BIRDS CHIRP CHEERFULLY EVERY MORNING.
I LOVE TAKING LONG WALKS IN THE PARK.
READING BOOKS IS MY FAVORITE HOBBY.
NATURE ALWAYS FINDS A WAY TO INSPIRE US.
THE WIND WHISPERS SECRETS THROUGH THE TREES.  
CHILDREN LAUGH AND PLAY UNDER THE BLUE SKY.  
RAINDROPS TAP GENTLY ON THE WINDOWPANE.  
MOUNTAINS STAND TALL, PROUD, AND SILENT.  
EVERY MOMENT IN NATURE TELLS A STORY.
